# thundastrike
A fullstack web and mobile app development project of mine, aiming to create a modern-looking app that enables clients to see their PTs availability, and book in with them online.

First iteration will be to create the basic GUI and availability/booking functionality
Second iteration will be to add additional functions, such as cancellations/rescheduling
Third iteration will aim to introduce an online payment rail between client and PT, offering refunds where necessary
